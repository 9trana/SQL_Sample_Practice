## SQL SELECT Basics

### 1. The example uses a WHERE clause to show the population of 'France'. Note that strings should be in 'single quotes'; modify it to show the population of Germany.
```sql
SELECT population FROM world
  WHERE name = 'Germany';
```

### 2. Checking a list. The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list. The example shows the name and population for the countries 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India' and 'China'. Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway' and 'Denmark'.
```sql
SELECT name, population FROM world
  WHERE name IN ('Norway', 'Sweden', 'Denmark');
```

### 3. Which countries are not too small and not too big? BETWEEN allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). The example below shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km. Modify it to show the country and the area for countries with an area between 200,000 and 250,000.
```sql
SELECT name, area FROM world
  WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000;
```

## SQL SELECT from WORLD Tutorial

### 1. Observe the result of running this SQL command to show the name, continent and population of all countries.
```sql
SELECT name, continent, population FROM world;
```

### 2. Show the name for the countries that have a population of at least 200 million. 200 million is 200000000, there are eight zeros.
```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE population >= 200000000;
```

### 3. Give the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at least 200 million.
```sql
SELECT name, gdp/population FROM world 
  WHERE population >= 200000000;
```

### 4. Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.
```sql
SELECT name, population/1000000 FROM world 
  WHERE continent = 'South America';
```

### 5. Show the name and population for France, Germany, and Italy.
```sql
SELECT name, population FROM world 
  WHERE name IN ('France', 'Germany', 'Italy');
```

### 6. Show the countries which have a name that includes the word 'United'.
```sql
SELECT name FROM world 
  WHERE name LIKE 'UNITED%';
```

### 7. Two ways to be big: A country is big if it has an area of more than 3 million sq km or it has a population of more than 250 million. Show the countries that are big by area or big by population. Show name, population and area.
```sql
SELECT name, population, area FROM world 
  WHERE area > 3000000 OR population > 250000000;
```

### 8. Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area (more than 3 million) or big by population (more than 250 million) but not both. Show name, population and area. Australia has a big area but a small population, it should be included. Indonesia has a big population but a small area, it should be included. China has a big population and big area, it should be excluded. United Kingdom has a small population and a small area, it should be excluded.
```sql
SELECT name, population, area FROM world 
  WHERE area > 3000000 XOR population > 250000000;
```

### 9. Show the name and population in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Use the ROUND function to show the values to two decimal places. For Americas show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.
```sql
SELECT name, ROUND(population/1000000,2), ROUND(gdp/1000000000,2) FROM world 
  WHERE continent = 'South America';
```

### 10. Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this value to the nearest 1000. Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000.
```sql
SELECT name, ROUND(gdp/population/1000,0)*1000 FROM world 
  WHERE gdp > 1000000000000;
```

### 11. Greece has capital Athens. Each of the strings 'Greece', and 'Athens' has 6 characters. Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters. You can use the LENGTH function to find the number of characters in a string.
```sql
SELECT name, capital FROM world
  WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital);
```

### 12. The capital of Sweden is Stockholm. Both words start with the letter 'S'. Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word. You can use the function LEFT to isolate the first character. You can use <> as the NOT EQUALS operator.
```sql
SELECT name, capital FROM world
  WHERE LEFT(name,1) = LEFT(capital,1) AND name <> capital;
```

### 13. Equatorial Guinea and Dominican Republic have all of the vowels (a e i o u) in the name. They don't count because they have more than one word in the name. Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name. You can use the phrase name NOT LIKE '%a%' to exclude characters from your results. The query shown misses countries like Bahamas and Belarus because they contain at least one 'a'.
```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '%a%'
    AND name LIKE '%e%'
    AND name LIKE '%i%'
    AND name LIKE '%o%'
    AND name LIKE '%u%'
    AND name NOT LIKE '% %';
```
