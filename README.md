# SQL_Sample_Practice
Repository for my self-directed SQL education
Inception: September 10th 2024
In this repository, each branch will represent different SQL coding projects I am using as learning instruments. Some will be idiosyncratic, developed from Chat GPT Queries in an attempt to create real-world relevance, others will be publicly available coding challenges on Kaggle, or other websites. Feel free to use, comment, fork and tweak.
